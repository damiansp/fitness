# Strength Training
A weight training program that focuses on high-weight/low-reps with the goal of building strength efficiently. I was motivated to start doing this after reading Dr. Peter Attia's book _Outlive_, that suggests gaining strengh is one of the best things people can do to maintain good health into old age.
